/*
Editorial:
Let's maintain the bounds L,R â€” the segment of heights in which hi can currently be. Initially, L=R=0
.

Now, we will iterate from i=1 to n. We could have risen by 1, so R increases by 1. We also cannot rise above ri or drop below li,
so if R>ri, then R=ri, and if L<li, then L=li. If at any point L>R, then such an array d does not exist. Otherwise, it can be restored in reverse.

The final asymptotic complexity is O(n)
*/

/* 
My Note:

Let's keep track of current height. h = 0
For given values, change it accordingly. 
For unknown values, keep track of them to use later.
For h < lower range, it's either over or we can try to use some previous unknown values to increase h and make it at least equal to lower range.
Since, height cannot decrease, it's optimal to use the last unknown value first.
For h > higher range, it's over.
If, there are unknown values left and h + num of unknown values > higher range, we need to set some of them 0 so we don't increase them later thus making the current move impossible.
This continues for i = 0 to N
